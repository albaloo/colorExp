This is the file we'll type our HTML into. See the code with the <code class=\"xml\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;&gt;</span></code>s? That's HTML! Like any language, it has its own special <strong>syntax</strong> (rules for communicating).</p> <p>When we press Save &amp; Submit Code, the results tab will act like an Internet <strong>browser</strong> (<em>e.g.</em> Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer). A browser's job is to transform the code in <code class=\"ruby\"><span class=\"identifier\"><span class=\"keymethods\">test</span></span>.<span class=\"identifier\">html</span></code> into a recognizable webpage!

    tutorial = "<p>To learn more HTML, we should learn how to talk about HTML. Already you have seen we use <code class=\"xml\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;&gt;</span></code>s a lot. </p>
<ol>
<li>Things inside <code class=\"xml\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;&gt;</span></code>s are called <strong>tags</strong>.</li>
<li>Tags nearly always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
<li>Example of opening tag: <code class=\"xml\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"xmltitle\">html</span>&gt;</span></code></li>
<li>Example of closing tag: <code class=\"xml\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"xmltitle\">html</span>&gt;</span></code></li>
</ol>
<p>You can think of tags as being like parentheses: whenever you open one, you should close it. Tags also <strong>nest</strong>, so you should close them in the right order: the most recently opened tag should be the first one closed, like in the example below.</p>
<pre><code class=\"xml\"><span class=\"tag\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"xmltitle\"><span class=\"xmltitle\">first</span></span> <span class=\"attribute\"><span class=\"attribute\">tag</span></span>&gt;</span></span><span class=\"tag\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"xmltitle\"><span class=\"xmltitle\">second</span></span> <span class=\"attribute\"><span class=\"attribute\">tag</span></span>&gt;</span></span>Some text!<span class=\"tag\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"xmltitle\"><span class=\"xmltitle\">second</span></span> <span class=\"attribute\"><span class=\"attribute\">tag</span></span>&gt;</span></span><span class=\"tag\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"xmltitle\"><span class=\"xmltitle\">first</span></span> <span class=\"attribute\"><span class=\"attribute\">tag</span></span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The last exercise taught us how to set up our HTML file. Everything we do now will go between <code class=\"xml\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"xmltitle\">html</span>&gt;</span></code> and <code class=\"xml\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"xmltitle\">html</span>&gt;</span></code>.</p>
